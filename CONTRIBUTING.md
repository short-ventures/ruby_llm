# Contributing to RubyLLM

## Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/crmne/ruby_llm/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/crmne/ruby_llm/issues/new). Include a **title and clear description**, relevant information, and a **code sample** demonstrating the issue.

* **Verify it's a RubyLLM bug**, not your application code, before opening an issue.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Run `overcommit --install` before committing - it handles code style and tests automatically.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* **First check if this belongs in RubyLLM or your application:**
  - ✅ Core LLM communication (provider integrations, streaming, cost tracking)
  - ❌ Application architecture (RAG, agents, prompt templates, testing helpers)

* Features we'll reject:
  - Multi-agent orchestration
  - RAG pipelines
  - Prompt management systems
  - Vector database integrations
  - Testing frameworks
  - Anything you can implement in 5-10 lines of application code

* Start by opening an issue to discuss the feature and its design. We want to keep RubyLLM simple and focused.

## Quick Start

```bash
gh repo fork crmne/ruby_llm --clone && cd ruby_llm
bundle install
overcommit --install  # Required - sets up git hooks
gh issue develop 123 --checkout  # or create your own branch
# make changes, add tests
gh pr create --web
```

## Testing

```bash
overcommit --run

# Re-recording VCR cassettes (requires API keys):
rake vcr:record[openai,anthropic]  # Specific providers
rake vcr:record[all]               # Everything
```

Always check cassettes for leaked API keys before committing.

## Important Notes

* **Never edit `models.json`, `aliases.json`, or `available-models.md`** - they're auto-generated by `rake models`
* **Write tests** for any new functionality
* **Keep it simple** - if it needs extensive documentation, reconsider the approach
* Model data comes from [models.dev](https://models.dev/). If you spot issues in the upstream registry, please report them via their site or repo.

## Response Times

This is my gift to the Ruby community.

Gifts don't come with SLAs. I respond when I can.

## Support
