        as old as some other languages like C or Java. \n\nWait, I think the creator''s

        call him Matz. Yeah, Matz is a common nickname for him. Let me try to recall
        more details. Was he from Japan? I think so. Maybe he worked at a company
        in Japan? I think he was involved with some other projects before creating
        Ruby. Oh, right, he was a programmer and worked on some other systems. \n\nI
        also remember that Ruby was created in the mid-90s. Maybe around 1995? I think
        that''s when he started developing it. The name Ruby comes from the gemstone,

        I should make sure there''s not another person associated with Ruby. Sometimes
        people confuse creators of similar languages. For example, Python was created
        by Guido van Rossum, and PHP by Rasmus Lerdorf. But Ruby is definitely Matsumoto.
        \n\nLet me check if there''s any other possible names. I don''t think so.
        He''s the main creator. Also, he''s still involved with Ruby, maybe maintaining

        creator is Yukihiro Matsumoto, known as Matz. He created Ruby in the mid-90s,
        and the language is named after the gemstone. I think that''s correct. I can''t

        developing Ruby in the mid-1990s as a response to his frustrations with other

        simplicity, productivity, and elegance.","reasoning_content":"\nOkay, the
        user asked when Yukihiro Matsumoto created Ruby. I remember that the user
        previously asked who the creator was, and I mentioned Matsumoto. Now they''re
        following up with the year.\n\nI need to recall the exact year. I think Ruby
        was first released in 1995. Let me double-check that. Matsumoto started working
        on Ruby in the mid-90s, and the first version, 0.2, came out in 1995. The
        first official release was 1.0 in 1997. So the creation year is 1995. \n\nWait,
        sometimes people might confuse the first release with the creation. But the
        user is asking for the year he created it, which would be when he started
        developing it, not the first release. However, the first public release was
        in 1995. So the answer is 1995. I should make sure to mention both the start
        of development and the first release to avoid confusion. Also, maybe note
        that the first version was 0.2 in 1995 and 1.0 in 1997. That way, the user
        gets a complete picture. \n\nI should also check if there''s any conflicting
        information. From what I know, Matsumoto started working on Ruby in 1993,
        but the first public release was in 1995. So the answer should clarify that
        the creation year is 1995, with the first release in that year. Maybe mention
        the initial development started earlier but the official creation was in 1995.
        That way, the user understands the timeline accurately.\n","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1768582292,"id":"chatcmpl-7nL39zytwExnOhpj9yt1se4zQWqSd25q","model":"qwen3","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":469,"completion_tokens_details":{"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"reasoning_tokens":354,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"draft_tokens":0,"draft_tokens_acceptance":0.0,"prompt_tokens":124,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":16},"prompt_tokens_per_second":2107.016023517018,"time_per_output_token_ms":8.166816631130065,"time_to_first_token_ms":58.851,"tokens_per_second":122.44673110306228,"total_tokens":593}}'
