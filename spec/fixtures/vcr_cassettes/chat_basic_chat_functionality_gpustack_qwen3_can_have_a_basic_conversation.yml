        sum of 2 and 2 is **4**. \n\nIn basic arithmetic, adding two numbers means
        combining their quantities. So, 2 + 2 equals 4. This is a fundamental concept
        in mathematics and applies in standard base-10 numbering systems unless specified
        otherwise (e.g., modular arithmetic or other contexts). \n\n**Answer:** 4.","reasoning_content":"\nOkay,
        let''s see. The user is asking \"What''s 2 + 2?\" That seems straightforward.
        I know that 2 plus 2 is 4. But wait, maybe they want a more detailed explanation?
        Let me think. Sometimes people might be testing if I understand basic arithmetic,
        or they might be looking for a different answer. But in standard math, 2 +
        2 equals 4. Is there any context where this might not be the case? Like in
        modular arithmetic or some other system? For example, in modulo 3, 2 + 2 would
        be 1, but the question doesn''t specify that. So I should assume it''s in
        the usual base 10 system. Also, the user might just be checking if I can answer
        a simple question. I should make sure to explain it clearly, maybe even break
        it down. Let me confirm: 2 plus 2 is 4. Yes, that''s correct. I should also
        consider if there''s any trick or if they''re using a different notation.
        But no, the question is pretty direct. So the answer is 4. I''ll go with that.\n","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1768582282,"id":"chatcmpl-hS26r6wouAPJnrWiFLXGP6wvrNWqbQre","model":"qwen3","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":316,"completion_tokens_details":{"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"reasoning_tokens":239,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"draft_tokens":0,"draft_tokens_acceptance":0.0,"prompt_tokens":16,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_per_second":223.38880822070817,"time_per_output_token_ms":7.893575949367088,"time_to_first_token_ms":71.624,"tokens_per_second":126.68529528498179,"total_tokens":332}}'
