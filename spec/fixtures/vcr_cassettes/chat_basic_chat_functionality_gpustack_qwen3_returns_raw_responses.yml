        capital of France is **Paris**. It is a major cultural, economic, and political
        center in Europe, known for landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum,
        and its rich history as a hub of art and literature.","reasoning_content":"\nOkay,
        the user is asking for the capital of France. I know that France is a country
        in Europe, and I remember that its capital is Paris. But wait, let me make
        sure I''m not confusing it with another country. For example, the capital
        of Spain is Madrid, and the capital of Italy is Rome. So, France''s capital
        is definitely Paris. I should also mention that Paris is not only the capital
        but also a major cultural and economic hub. Maybe add a bit about its history
        or significance to give more context. Let me double-check if there''s any
        other city that could be considered the capital, but I don''t think so. The
        answer should be straightforward.\n","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1768582284,"id":"chatcmpl-Hr06anbpAg2gDatkM35lQ7nu0PMArXhG","model":"qwen3","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":193,"completion_tokens_details":{"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"reasoning_tokens":140,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"draft_tokens":0,"draft_tokens_acceptance":0.0,"prompt_tokens":15,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":3},"prompt_tokens_per_second":1088.8501742160279,"time_per_output_token_ms":7.772383419689119,"time_to_first_token_ms":13.776,"tokens_per_second":128.66066250241656,"total_tokens":208}}'
