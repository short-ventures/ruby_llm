        let me see. The user wants me to call the any_of_params function for the task
        \"Review PR\" with status \"pending\" and report the result.\n\nFirst, I need
        to check the function''s parameters. The function requires \"task\" and \"status\".
        The status can be either \"pending\", \"done\", or null. Since the user provided
        \"pending\", that''s valid. The task is \"Review PR\", which is a string.
        \n\nWait, the parameters are set up with anyOf for status. So the status can
        be a string from the enum or null. The user specified \"pending\", which is
        in the enum, so that''s acceptable. The task is straightforward, just a string.
        \n\nI should structure the JSON arguments with task as \"Review PR\" and status
        as \"pending\". No need for null here. Let me make sure the JSON is correctly
        formatted. The function name is any_of_params. So the tool_call should include
        the name and the arguments. \n\nI think that''s all. Let me put it into the
        tool_call format.\n","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_nerroqdt","index":0,"type":"function","function":{"name":"any_of_params","arguments":"{\"status\":\"pending\",\"task\":\"Review
