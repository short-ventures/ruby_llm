        me think. The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by
        itself, gives the original number. So, for 64, I need to find a number that
        when squared equals 64.\n\nHmm, 8 times 8 is 64. Wait, but there''s also -8,
        because negative numbers squared also give positive results. However, when
        people ask for the square root, they usually mean the principal (positive)
        root. So the answer should be 8.\n\nThe user wants the answer in a JSON object
        with the key `result`. So I need to structure it as {\"result\": 8}. Let me
        double-check. Yes, 8 squared is 64, and that''s the principal square root.
        Alright, that''s the correct answer.\n"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":212,"completion_tokens":10,"total_tokens":222}}
